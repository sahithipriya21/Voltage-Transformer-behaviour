# Voltage-Transformer-behaviour
This project showcases a meticulous and professional approach to developing and simulating a mathematical model that accurately represents the behavior of a voltage transformer during short circuit scenarios.

Open ElectricCircuitVoltageTransformerModeling.m in MATLAB.
Run the script to simulate the short circuit mode of the voltage transformer.
Analyze the outputs in Output 1.jpg and Output 2.jpg.
